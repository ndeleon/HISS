Code should have a database of what certain HISS language tokens are, 
and what they convert to in HTML and CSS. If this is possible, maybe using some sort of 
data matching systm to compare what you have and convert it to the HTML and CSS that it
finds. 

An example migt be something like this:


%[
text[12, 0 , Helvetica]
]%
~[
"hello"
]~


// codes to somehow:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<style>
		p {
			font-size: 12px;
			color: #000000;
			font-family: helvetica;
		}
	</style>
	<p> hello </p>
</html>

If I did something like having a text file with all of the syntax of HTML and CSS,
and what HISS syntax codes to in HTML.
